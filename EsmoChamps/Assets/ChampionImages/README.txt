Champion Images Folder
=====================

This folder contains images for your champions.

HOW TO ADD/CHANGE IMAGES:
1. Name your image file exactly as the champion name (e.g., 'Pembroke.png', 'Warper.jpg')
2. Place the image in this folder
3. Supported formats: .png, .jpg, .jpeg, .bmp
4. Recommended size: 512x512 pixels or larger (square images work best)

NOTES:
- Default images were copied from the application's Assets folder on first run
- You can replace any image by simply overwriting the file
- Images are loaded automatically when viewing champions
- If an image is missing, the champion's first letter will be shown instead
